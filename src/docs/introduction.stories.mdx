## üèÅ Introduction

[storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open-source platform that allows developers to keep a consistent overview of the pieces and pages that all make the platform.
In their own words;

> Storybook is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, and Angular. It makes building stunning UIs organized and efficient.

There are various implemenations possible with storybook and the effectiveness of those implemenations differ per project.
For our projects we use a simplistic, yet effective approach of displaying pure components and only combine those components into pages if it makes sense to do so.

### üõ† How it works

When initiating a project we start out by working out all the different components that exist within the desings.
Those components are created and then replicated in something that storybook calls 'stories'. Stories are a simple representation of the component and the different varations it has within the platform.

These stories are fun look at on it's own but the fun is just starting. [Addons](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons) for storybook is where the party really starts.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è [Addons](https://storybook.js.org/addons/)

There is a big landscape of storybook owned/maintained addons and some community build ones. It's easy to get overwhelmed when creating a the perfect setup but I think there is a minimal set of addons that can jumpstart any project.
This is the reason why we are making use of a small selection addons of the various addon possibilities within storybook. The following addons are added to this project; [docs](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/docs), [controls](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/controls), [actions](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/actions), [viewport](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/viewport).
These addons allow for the components we make to be viewed in more documented way, allows for manipulating of the components and enables to choose diferent screen-size to view how that impacts the components (and pages).

#### üíÖ [Theming](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/theming)

We all love our colours, fonts and logo's. Especially our logo's!
With this addon we override the default (and boring, but solid) theming storybook provides out of the box and inject it with our owns settings.

If you are a developer and are looking on how to make sure your storybook project utilizes brand colours, logo's and fonts?

#### üìö [Docs](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/docs)

This addon enables a different view from the canvas view. It enables to view all variations within one page and gives more of a documentation style of view.
It has a collapsible box to show the actual code example that was used in the story and displays the different properties that can be passed to the component to influence it's appreance.

This is the perfect place to show the product to someone at a glance but still get a detailed way of possibilities and possible implementations.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è [Controls](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/controls)

This awesome new development within storybook alters the way developers write their stories.
Where we used to manually write every property out by hand and define its possible values this is now autogenerated (especially nice for typescript) and manipulates the appearance of the component in real time.

#### üìù [actions](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/actions)

One of the older addons from this list, but it has been steady on the list since it's inception. This allows to visualize, in the form of logging, certain actions that can be initiated through certain actions.

The most simple example that demonstrates the purpose of this addon is a button. A button can be used for many different things (code wise) but is only used for one purpose for the customer, which is to click the button.
Some click actions can be recreated within storybook but when writing stupidly simple stories (which is where storybooks thrives by) adding logic just to make the button work is too much overhead.
In this case we could still pass a function to the button by replacing all that logic with a simple `action('clicked')`.
Which when fired will log this in a way that is visible for you.

This allows for rapid development and gives a clear indication of the 'action(s)' a user executes during storybook usage.

#### üì± [viewport](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/viewport)

Viewport is an enhancer that powers up storybook with the absolute powers of responsiveness. It allows to choose a viewport in which the component will be displayed. Very usefull if you want to check how the components looks on different sized screens.

By default we extend the breakpoints to be part of the viewports because those are the screen sizes on which the design differs. Besides the breakpoints we also make use of the default extensive list of devices provided by addon;

| OS      | Devices                                                                                                                    |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| iOS     | iPhone 5, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 plus, iPhone 8 plus, iPhone X, iPhone XR, iPhone XS Max, iPad, iPad Pro 10.5', iPad Pro 12.9' |
| Android | Galaxy S5, Galaxy S9, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel, Pixel XL                                                                  |

If you feel like you're missing a viewport or device feel free to submit a request to add a specific device.
